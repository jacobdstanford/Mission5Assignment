        Improving your long distance running abilities
    </h1>

    <!-- Intro Paragraph -->
    <p class="lead text-center">
        As a member of the most elite distance running squad in the country, 
        I have learned a lot about what it takes to become one of the greatest. 
        Coached by the legendary Coach Ed Eyestone, I have seen tremendous growth 
        over the past 3 years. A chance was taken on me, and because of that, 
        I was able to become so much more than what I was.

    <!-- Paragraphs About the Hobby -->
    <p>
        Although I began sports at a young age, it took a few tries to find where I thrived 
        the best. Distance running calls to those who are built for the high demands of the 
        sport. Instead of being daunted by the high demands of what the sport entails, 
        we are enthralled by the sense of purpose and responsibility that being a 
        skilled distance runner provides.

        My journey has taken me to especially focus on mastering the 10,000m race. This race 
        is 25 laps on a track, and is the ultimate test of endurance and patience. Being just 
        a fraction of a second off your goal pace can make a huge difference—you could either 
        be too slow and miss your mark, or go out too fast and be forced to slow down later. 
        With the help of the training that I have received from the very best, I can teach 
        you to master this distance.

        Being a member of the BYU men's cross country and track team has been a huge honor. 
        I have been present for both of the team's national titles, and I have been a part 
        in building up the team to what it is today. I am so grateful for my time as a Coug, 
        and I hope to be in contact to help you fulfill your distance running dreams!
